  I am a 6th year PhD Candidate in the Economics Department at Columbia University. I am on the 2022-2023 Job Market.

  I primarily work in International Trade and Urban Economics, with an interest in Real Estate.

  My CV is [here](/files/cv_full.pdf).


## Job Market Paper {#research}
### [Consumer Cities: The Role of Housing Variety](/files/Abstract.pdf)

**Abstract:** This paper estimates theoretically-founded housing price indices that account for differences in housing variety availability, where some varieties are available in certain cities but not others. I develop a model of housing demand and city choice that incorporates differentiated housing varieties and the discrete-nature of housing decisions. For estimation, I develop a method to jointly estimate the nests that varieties belong to and the elasticity of substitution across varieties within each nest. I find that households in larger cities benefit from having access to varieties not available in smaller cities. These consumption amenities are quantitatively large: the elasticity with respect to population is a third of the elasticity of housing prices with respect to population. After accounting for consumption amenities, real income increases with city size.

### Learning from Exporting 

*(draft available upon request)*

**Abstract:** How do we model and quantify the dynamic gains from exporting? I develop a dynamic trade model where firms innovate and learn from other firms in the destinations they sell to. The evolution of a country's stock of knowledge can be expressed as a function of export flows and the stocks of knowledge of their trading partners. I find evidence that countries in Asia, North America, and Europe, as well as countries in the top two quartiles of TFP growth were able to better absorb foreign insights than other countries. I evaluate whether there are dynamic gains from trade with two counterfactual exercises. First, I measure the impact of changing trade costs between 1962 and 2000. I find small static gains but zero dynamic gains for the world economy. Second, I quantify the dynamic gains from export-induced foreign knowledge flows by simulating a counterfactual where there is no learning from foreign sources. I find that domestic learning compensates for foreign learning: there are large dynamic gains from exporting when there is no domestic learning and small dynamic gains when there is domestic learning.
